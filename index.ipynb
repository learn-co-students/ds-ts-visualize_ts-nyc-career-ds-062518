    "* Explore the temporal structure of time series with line plots, lag plots, and autocorrelation plots.\n",

    "For this lab, we shall use a more interesting dataset `temp.csv` which carries the minimum daily temperatures over 10 years (1981-1990) in the city Melbourne, Australia. The units are in degrees Celsius and there are 3,650 observations. The [SOURCE](https://datamarket.com/data/set/2324/daily-minimum-temperatures-in-melbourne-australia-1981-1990) of the data is credited as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.\n",
